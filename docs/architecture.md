# Application Architecture

## Overview

MyWebApp is built using ASP.NET Core 8.0 with the Razor Pages architectural pattern. This document outlines the application's structure, design patterns, and architectural decisions.

## Architectural Pattern: Razor Pages

Razor Pages is a page-focused framework that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive than using controllers and views.

### Key Characteristics

- **Page-centric**: Each page combines the view (`.cshtml`) with its model (`.cshtml.cs`)
- **Convention over Configuration**: Follows naming conventions for routing and organization
- **Simplified Development**: Reduces ceremony compared to MVC for simple scenarios
- **Testable**: Page models can be unit tested independently

## Application Structure

### Core Components

```
MyWebApp Architecture
├── Program.cs (Entry Point)
├── Middleware Pipeline
├── Razor Pages
├── Static File Serving
├── Configuration System
└── Logging System
```

### 1. Application Entry Point (`Program.cs`)

The entry point configures and bootstraps the application:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
var app = builder.Build();
```

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Service registration and dependency injection setup
- Middleware pipeline configuration
- Application startup and hosting

### 2. Middleware Pipeline

The request processing pipeline is configured in the following order:

1. **Exception Handling**
   - Development: Developer exception page
   - Production: Custom error handler (`/Error`)

2. **Security Middleware**
   - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
   - HTTPS Redirection

3. **Static File Middleware**
   - Serves files from `wwwroot/`
   - CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts

4. **Routing Middleware**
   - Maps URLs to Razor Pages
   - Convention-based routing

5. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Ready for authentication/authorization features

6. **Razor Pages Middleware**
   - Processes Razor Page requests
   - Model binding and execution

### 3. Razor Pages Structure

Each page consists of two files:

#### View File (`.cshtml`)
- Contains HTML markup and Razor syntax
- Binds to the associated Page Model
- Uses shared layout for consistent UI

#### Page Model (`.cshtml.cs`)
- Inherits from `PageModel`
- Contains page logic and data
- Handles HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.)

**Example Structure:**
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly ILogger<IndexModel> _logger;
    
    public IndexModel(ILogger<IndexModel> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public void OnGet()
    {
        // Handle GET requests
    }
}
```

### 4. Layout System

The application uses a hierarchical layout system:

- **_Layout.cshtml**: Master layout template
- **_ViewStart.cshtml**: Sets default layout for all pages
- **_ViewImports.cshtml**: Common using statements and directives

### 5. Static Asset Management

Static assets are organized in `wwwroot/`:

- **CSS**: Custom styles and third-party frameworks
- **JavaScript**: Application scripts and libraries
- **Images**: Icons, logos, and media files
- **Libraries**: Client-side packages (Bootstrap, jQuery)

## Design Patterns

### 1. Page Model Pattern
Each page encapsulates its logic in a dedicated model class, promoting:
- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Code organization

### 2. Dependency Injection
Built-in DI container provides:
- Loose coupling
- Testability
- Service lifetime management

### 3. Configuration Pattern
Hierarchical configuration system:
- Base settings in `appsettings.json`
- Environment-specific overrides
- Runtime configuration updates

### 4. Logging Pattern
Structured logging with:
- Configurable log levels
- Multiple log providers
- Correlation IDs for request tracking

## Data Flow

### Request Processing Flow

1. **Incoming Request**
   - HTTP request received by Kestrel server
   - Request enters middleware pipeline

2. **Middleware Processing**
   - Security checks (HSTS, HTTPS)
   - Static file handling (if applicable)
   - Routing resolution

3. **Page Execution**
   - Page model instantiation
   - Dependency injection
   - Handler method execution (OnGet, OnPost, etc.)

4. **View Rendering**
   - Model data binding
   - Razor view compilation
   - HTML generation

5. **Response Generation**
   - HTTP response creation
   - Static asset inclusion
   - Response transmission

### Page Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**
   - Page model constructor execution
   - Dependency injection

2. **Model Binding**
   - Request data binding to page model properties
   - Validation execution

3. **Handler Execution**
   - Appropriate handler method invocation
   - Business logic execution

4. **Result Processing**
   - View rendering or redirect processing
   - Response generation

## Security Architecture

### Built-in Security Features

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - HSTS headers in production

2. **Request Validation**
   - Anti-forgery token validation
   - Model state validation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Custom error pages
   - Sensitive information protection

### Security Best Practices Implemented

- Secure headers configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error information disclosure prevention
- HTTPS-only cookie settings (when authentication added)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
